<p>Netaji Subhash Chand Bose Island, Port Blair is in the Andaman Islands of India. This Island the erstwhile capital for the most of Andaman Islands from 1858 until an earthquake in 1941. Netaji Subhash Chand Bose Island was also the base for the British Administrator of the penal colony in Port Blair.In 1941, the Japanese converted the site into POW camp, and built war installations, remnants of which can still be seen. It now lies deserted, and the few signs of its colonial glory, such as the Chief Commissioner's house and the Presbyterian church, are dilapidated and overgrown. The area is now under the control of Indian Navy.</p>

<p>The Presbyterian Church at Ross Island was a protestant church built of stone and the windows had frames made of burma teak. The glass panes behind the altar were made of beautifully etched stained glass from Italy. The quality of the wood was so good that it survived the vagaries of weather for over a 100 years. A small structure south of the church was built to accommodate the parsonage.
Ross Island boasted of a superb bakery which offered one of the best confectioneries, bread loves, buns, cakes, croissants and many other delicacies of those times. The bakery was a tastefully constructed building based on the 19th century British architecture with all the modern facilities of the times including a self contained cook house.</p>
