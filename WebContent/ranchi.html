<p>Ranchi is the capital of the Indian state of Jharkhand.Ranchi was the centre of the Jharkhand movement, which called for a separate state for the tribal regions of South Bihar, northern Orissa, western West Bengal and the eastern area of what is present-day Chhattisgarh. The Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 by carving out the Bihar divisions of Chota Nagpur and Santhal Parganas. Ranchi has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi's flagship Smart Cities Mission.</p>

<p>During the time of British, the city was used to be the summer capital of Bihar. This is because of its climate during winter season.[8] Ranchi is also one of the oldest cities in Jharkhand. Jagannath Temple and Ratu Palace are the sights which are also witness for the history of Ranchi.[9]
 Now Ranchi is developing its economy. And for this its parks, special economic zones and industrial areas are being developed. Recently new sectors and modern areas are developed for the city's development. Ranchi is also called 'City of Waterfalls'</p>

 <p>According to one popular tale, Captain choose "Archi" a Oraon tribal village as headquarters. Archi means Bamboo forest in local Nagpuri dialect. The British inadvertently named "Archi" as "Ranchi". Captain Wilkinson renamed Kishunpur village as Rachi. Up to 1927, the place was known as Rachi.[12][13][14]
In his book The Mundas and Their Country, anthropologist Sarat Chandra Roy writes that the name of the city is derived from the Mundari word aranchi or "short stick" used in driving cattle.[15]
    According to another local story, the name of Ranchi comes from a local bird named "Rici" which was mostly found in the Pahari Mandir premise.[16] Rici is name for Black Kite (Milvus migrans) in Mundari language, the modern-day landmark of Ranchi city, the Pahari Mandir, is also known as Rici Buru (रिचि बुरु) - the hill of the kites,[17] and the city originated on the foothills of Rici Buru with the construction of Bada Talab by Commissioner Thomas Wilkinson at the same site.</p>
