<p>Nagaland became the 16th state of India on 1 December 1963. It has experienced insurgency and inter-ethnic conflict since the 1950s, limiting its economic development.
Agriculture is its most important economic activity, accounting for over 70% of its economy. Other significant activities include forestry, tourism, insurance, real estate, and miscellaneous cottage industries.
    It lies between the parallels of 98 and 96 degrees east longitude and 26.6 and 27.4 degrees latitude north. It is home to a rich variety of flora and fauna.</p>

 <p>The ancient history of the Nagas is unclear. Tribes migrated at different times, each settling in the northeastern part of present India and establishing their respective sovereign mountain terrains and village-states. There are no records of whether they came from the northern Mongolian region, southeast Asia or southwest China, except that their origins are from the east of India and that historical records show the present-day Naga people settled before the arrival of the Ahoms in 1228 CE.[8][10]
The origin of the word 'Naga' is also unclear.A popularly accepted, but controversial, view is that it originated from the Burmese word Na-Ka[11]' or 'naga', meaning "people with earrings." Others suggest it means pierced noses.Both naka and naga are pronounced the same way in Burmese.</p>
