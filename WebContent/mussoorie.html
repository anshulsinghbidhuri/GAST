<p>Mussoorie is a hill station and a municipal board in the Dehradun district of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is about 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the state capital of Dehradun and 290 km (180 mi) north of the national capital of New Delhi. The hill station is in the foothills of the Garhwal Himalayan range. The adjoining town of Landour, which includes a military cantonment, is considered part of "greater Mussoorie", as are the townships of Barlowganj and Jharipani.
Mussoorie is at an average altitude of 2,005 metres (6,578 ft). To the northeast are the Himalayan snow ranges, and to the south, the Doon Valley and Shiwalik ranges. The second highest point is the original Lal Tibba in Landour, with a height of over 2,275 m (7,464 ft). Mussoorie is popularly known as The Queen of the Hills</p>

<p>Buses leave from Dehradun train station. There are two buses which go to opposite ends of the Mussoorie Mall, Library and Picture Palace. It is quite a hike from one to the other, so make sure you catch the right one. To reach Kempty Falls directly from Dehra Dun catch a bus from the Dehra Dun Railway station Hill Bus Services Section or take a taxi. One should look for buses heading for destinations like Barkot, Nainbagh, Yamunotri, and Purola (Caution:sometimes Purola buses go via Vikas nagar which may take you off the route completely so be careful). You can also take a bus to the Library end of Mussoorie and walk to the Kempty Bus stop and take a bus or taxi or a milk van or even hitch a ride with a tourist going in that direction!! Bus fare for Library end or Kulri end (from Dehradun) is INR60. Toll Tax is payable on entering Kempty Village per bus/taxi/car/scooter. Bus fare from library end to kempty is around INR15.
 The last bus from Dehradun to Mussoorie leaves at around 8pm. The last bus might be extremely packed so make sure you get to the bus station early.</p>

 <p>Lal Tibba. A scenic 5 km uphill walk from Picture Palace to the highest point in Mussoorie. Passes through Landour Bazaar.Old light house is the nice thing to see there.  edit
    Kempty Falls - about 15 km from Mussoorie, this now over-built spot is a popular tourist destination. Catch a taxi or a bus from the Library stand. This place is a must see place for tourists coming into Mussorie. There are 2 ways of reaching the falls. 1. By the steps provided nearby or by cable car where you have to pay Rs.80 for the ride going down as well as for coming up the falls. Keep the ticket with you when you come down because the operators will not let you in again to go back on top without the ticket. There is a man-made pool right next to the falls where kids as well as adults can play in the pool. There are many shops near the waterfalls selling swimwear for rent and several clean changing rooms for Ladies and Gents separately. There are many shacks selling food cooked right in front of you like eggs and maggie noodles and paranthas to have while enjoying the scenic beauty. There are also many professional photographers waiting to take your picture and printing it and giving it to you in minutes when you come back from the falls. Beware they charge exhorbitant fees and keep taking pictures of you even if you don't want them to. Be very firm in saying no right at the beginning when you get down from your vehicle.
