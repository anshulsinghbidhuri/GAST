<p>Sohra, also spelled as Cherrapunjee and Charrapunji, is a town in East Khasi Hills district in the Indian state of Meghalaya. It is credited as being the wettest place on Earth. However, nearby Mawsynram has more rainfall nowadays, and both are surpassed by Lloró, Colombia.
 It is the traditional capital of a hima (Khasi tribal chieftainship constituting a petty state) known as Sohra or Churra.</p>

<p>The original name for this town was Sohra, pronounced as "Churra" by the British before morphing into the present one. Despite perennial rain, Cherrapunji faces an acute water shortage and the inhabitants often have to trek for miles to obtain potable water. Irrigation is also hampered due to excessive rain washing away the topsoil as a result of human encroachment into the forests. Now the Meghalaya State government has decided to rename Cherrapunji to its local name "Sohra". There is a monument to David Scott (British Administrator in NE India, 1802–31) in Cherrapunji cemetery.</p>

 <p>View of Bangladesh plains from Cherrapunjee:
The cliffs of Cherrapunji receive heavy rainfall due to monsoon winds blowing from the Bay of Bengal. Thus, the region is home to extremely wet weather. Cherrapunji's yearly rainfall average stands at 11,777 millimetres (463.7 in). Cherrapunji receives both the Southwest and Northeast monsoon showers which give it a single monsoon season. It lies in the windward side of the Khasi Hills. In the winter months it receives the northeast monsoon showers which travel down the Brahmaputra valley.</p>
