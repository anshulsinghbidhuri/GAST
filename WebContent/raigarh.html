<p>Raigarh is a city in Eastern Chhattisgarh known as Sanskardhani i.e. Cultural Capital of Chhattisgarh. It is also known for its coal reserves and power generation for the state as well as the country.
With a population of just about 1,64,000, it is a rapidly growing industrial city and home to the Mohan Jute Mill, one of the oldest jute mills in India and the only one in Madhya Pradesh prior to the splitting off of Chhattisgarh in 2000. Raigarh is also a major producer of steel and iron ore as well as the cultural and industrial capital of Chhattisgarh. Jindal Steel and Power Limited is a major steel plant based in Raigarh.

<p>The tradition preserved by the ruling family of the erstwhile state of Raigarh maintains that the Raj Gond family migrated to this region from Bairagarh/Wariagarh of Chanda district of Maharashtra state about the beginning of the eighteenth century and first stayed at Phuljhar in Raipur district. From there Madan Singh, head of the family migrated to Banda of the present day Raigarh. The successor kings of Raigarh state after Maharaja Madan Singh were Maharaja Takhat Singh, Maharaha Beth Singh, Maharaja Dilip Singh, Maharaja Jujhar Singh, Maharaja Devnath Singh, Maharaja Ghansyam Singh, Maharaja Bhupdev Singh, Maharaja Natwar Singh and Maharaja Chakradhar Singh. Truly speaking music, dance, and literature got fillip during the reign of Maharaja Bhupdev Singh and developed further during the rule of Maharaja Chakradhar Singh.[1] Prior to Indian Independence, Raigarh was capital of Princely State of Raigarh.[2] After the independence of the country, the princely state was the first ones to join the Union of India. The Royal family still resides here, but due to Privy Purse and internal conflicts, the royalty seems to have faded away.[original research?] Moreover, the palace - Moti Mahal - is in very bad shape. It has recently been declared a heritage site by the state government.</p>

Located around National Highway 216, it lies 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) to the south-east of the old town of Raigarh and 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the proposed NTPC Lara-Pussore site. Kodatarai Airport (the future domestic airport of Chhattisgarh) separates the old Raigarh, new Raigarh, and the NTPC site. Naya Raigarh will serve as the industrial capital of the state and also cater to the infrastructure needs of industry and trade in the region. Naya Raigarh is spread over an area of about 600 acres (240 ha) and includes a number of villages of which Kodatarai village forms the core of the Naya Raigarh.
