<p>Mount Abu is a hill station in the Aravalli Range in Pindwara - Abu Assembly Constituency Of Sirohi district of Rajasthan state in western India, near the border with Gujarat. The mountain forms a rocky plateau 22 km long by 9 km wide. The highest peak on the mountain is Guru Shikhar at 1,722 m (5,650 ft) above sea level. It is referred to[by whom?] as 'an oasis in the desert' as its heights are home to rivers, lakes, waterfalls and evergreen forests. The nearest train station is Abu Road railway station: 28 km away.</p>

<p>Mount Abu town, the only hill station in Rajasthan, is at an elevation of 1,220 m (4,003 ft). It has been a popular retreat from the heat of Rajasthan and neighboring Gujarat for centuries.
 The mountain is home to several Hindu temples, including the Adhar Devi Temple (also known as Arbuda Devi Temple), carved out of the solid rock; the Shri Raghunathji Temple; and a shrine and temple to Dattatreya built atop the Guru Shikhar peak; and the Achaleshwar Mahadev Temple (1412).
The Achalgarh Fort, built in the 14th century by Kumbha of Mewar, is nearby and at its center is the popular visitor attraction of the Nakki Lake. The Toad Rock is on a hill near the lake. Close to the fort is the Achaleshwar Mahadev Temple, a popular Shiva temple. Also, Achal Fort Jain Temple, Kantinath Jain Temple (1513) is equally famous.
The Durga Ambika Mata Temple lies in a cleft of rock in Jagat, just outside Mount Abu town.</p>

 <p>The mountain is also the home to a number of Jain temples including Dilwara Temples, a complex of temples carved out of white marble. The Dilwara Temples or Delvada Temples are located about 2Â½ kilometers from the Mount Abu settlement, Rajasthan's only hill station. These Jain temples were built by Vimal Shah and designed by Vastupala, Jain ministers of Dholka,[9] between the 11th and 16th centuries and are famous for their use of white marble and intricate marble carvings.[10] They are a pilgrimage place of the Jains, and a popular general tourist attraction. The temples have an opulent entranceway, the simplicity in architecture reflecting Jain values like honesty and frugality.[11] The ornamental detail spreading over the minutely carved ceilings, doorways, pillars, and panels is simply marvelous.[12] The temple complex is in the midst of a range of forested hills. There are five temples in all, each with its own unique identity.[13] All five temples are enclosed within a single high walled compound. The group is named after the small village of Dilwara or Delvara in which they are located.</p>
