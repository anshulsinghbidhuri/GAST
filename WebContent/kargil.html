<p>Kargil is in Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, India. It is an important transit hub of Ladakh, with roads leading from here to Leh, Srinagar, and Padum in Zangskar. The unofficial capital of Muslim Ladakh, and capital of the Kargil district, it is still a small town. While interesting in many ways due to it’s historic position on the caravan routes, nothing of this is visible to the casual visitor. It is notorious with travellers as a necessary stop between Central Ladakh, Zangskar and Kashmir.It is now famous due to the Kargil Conflict, when the town, and surrounding areas, was shelled by Pakistani based militants.</p>

<p>Kargil provides excellent sites for trekking and mountaineering such as the Nun Kun Massif, also there is large scope for river rafting in the Zanskar region of Kargil district. Kargil is known all over India for its rich apricot orchards: during summer the entire valley changes into a beautiful orange colour.
One may have a look a the Munshi Aziz Bhat Museum for Central Asian Trade and artifacts which is the main attraction for tourists in Kargil town. One may have a visit to Gongma Kargil situated on the top of the town although the general area around Kargil has pleasant scenery and would make for nice walks. Otherwise, come prepared with a good book.
The Jameh Mosque in the main street is open for visitors, but although it is a Shiite mosque, it lacks the ornaments found in Iranian mosques.</p>
